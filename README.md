# NBA_REG_SEASON_STATS

This application lets you compare a series of statistical data stored in the NBA stats database, between the 2009-10 and the 2013-14 season.

The results are all given in "per game" basis, apart from total wins (per season) and the percentage variables. 
The variables that can be specified in the X and Y axes and in the color differentiation are the following:

- Team
- Season
- Wins: total per season, win %
- Achieved playoffs?
- Points scored
- Field goal: made, attempted, FG %
- 2-point: made, attempted, 2pt %
- 3-point: made, attempted, 3pt %
- Free throw: made, attempted, FT %
- Rebounds: offensive, defensive, total
- Assists 
- Steals
- Blocks
- Turnovers
- Personal fouls

If the color input is set to "None", the regression line for the X-Y relationship (lineal and/or curved) can be graphically observed.
